# Animal Trading Card Project

Welcome to the Animal Trading Card project! This project marks my first step in web development through Udacity. It involves creating a simple HTML and CSS page resembling a trading card, complete with interesting facts about a chosen animal. This README file will guide you through the project's purpose, how to use the code, and some tips on customization.

## Project Overview

The Animal Trading Card project is an exciting opportunity for me to showcase my beginner-level HTML and CSS skills. By designing and styling a trading card for an animal of my choice, I can practice structuring web content with HTML and adding visual appeal with CSS.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Animal Trading Card project:

1. Clone this repository to my local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `Animal-Trading-Card.html` file in my preferred web browser to view the example animal trading card.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
animal-trading-card/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Animal-Trading-Card.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ img/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ red-panda-ge1b181edf_1920.jpg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

- `Animal-Trading-Card.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the trading card.
- `css/`: This directory holds the CSS file for styling the trading card.
- `img/`: Place the animal image in this directory.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading.

## Customization

I can customize the trading card in the following ways:

1. **Animal Image**: Replace the placeholder `red-panda-ge1b181edf_1920.jpg` in the `img/` directory with an image of the chosen animal.

2. **Content**: Open the `Animal-Trading-Card.html` file and modify the content within the `<div class="card">...</div>` element. Update the animal's name, species, habitat, and fun fact.

3. **Styling**: Open the `styles.css` file in the `css/` directory to customize the visual appearance of the trading card. I can adjust colors, fonts, borders, and more to match my preferences.

## Contributing

This project is my individual effort as part of my Udacity learning experience. While I won't be accepting external contributions, I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Credits

This project was completed as part of my first project through Udacity's Frontend development course. Animal information was sourced from reputable wildlife websites.


I'm excited to embark on this journey of creating my first animal trading card using HTML and CSS! once again if you have any feedback please let me know. Happy coding! üêæüé®
